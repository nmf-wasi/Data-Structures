BST= Binary Tree + Binary Search
usually, we need a sorted array inorder to apply binary search. But, in Binary Search Tree, we dont have to make it sort. Rather, we will just have values liek this:

                        node->value
            nore->left->value < node->value
            nore->right->value > node->value
            node->left->value !=node->value
            node->right->value !=node->value
            
        This criteria is applied to whole left and right subtree
        each of the nodes' values should be less than root's value on the left side and should me more than root's value on the right side
        ! However, none of the node's values can be repeated
        We will keep a frequency array to keep the count if we get multiple nodes with same value
